classes/guilds

rogues:
  thieves - obvious
  pirates - should this be a guild? also obvious

fighters:
  warriors - or something
  rangers - hunters, basically. know a lot about nature

mages:
  haven't really come up with a good list
  druids?

cleric/psi: (need a good name)
  clerics: have the same ability as psionicists, but different spells
    (techniques or methods a better name than spells?). understand their
    abilities as faith and either a god does the spell, or a god enables them
    to do it.
  psionicists: psionic abilities understand them as a process
